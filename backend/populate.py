Studying dose response, and developing doseâ€“response models, is central to determining beneficial levels and dosages for drugs, pollutants, foods, and other substances to which humans or other organisms are exposed",

Two recti are situated on the either sides of the midline. They are dissected out by cutting its attachment from pubic symphysis from below, sternum from above and abdominal muscles from sides. The recti can be easily differentiated from other muscles because the recti are white and shiny whereas other muscles are pinkish in color.",
